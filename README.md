**redditLang** or PHL ( **P**rogramming **H**umor **L**anguage ) is a meme language devised by the r/ProgrammerHumor subreddit discord members

## Why Redditlang?

- 🔥 blazingly fast
- 🎮 cross platform
- very opinionated, only forcing the best of practices. For example, if you use inline macros, the police will be called with the message that a fire has broken out at your home, they will promptly come to put out your garbage code.
- sometimes typed
- If you still aren't devoting your entire carrer to this, it's like C ( minus the pointers ), Rust ( minus the copyright ) and JavaScript ( only the "good" features ) all in one neat package.

So what are you waiting for? Please invest your life savings in this!

> Compiler is WIP, if you are looking for it, it will be here.
> RedditLang will be compiled, a JIT implementation might exist in the future.

**note**: We have realized that we have a younger audience, so we have translated the spec into Gen Z Slang "to make it bussin". It is available [here](./RedditLang%20Spec%20GenZ.md), We will not convert this into an mdBook and this might might be outdated.
